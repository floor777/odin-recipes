# odin-recipes
This project will be a simple recipes page which has a homepage that leads to other pages with individual recipes. It will only be using the HTML that I have learned so far without anything else such as javascript or css. THe project will be revisited and upgraded once I reach those lessons. 

I will return and edit the README eventually to reflect on what I have learned in a practical way.
